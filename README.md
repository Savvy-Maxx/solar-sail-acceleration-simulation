#Optimizing Solar Sail Acceleration Using Reflectivity Variations

## Overview
This repository contains the simulation code and figures used in an independent physics research project analyzing how variable reflectivity affects solar sail acceleration.

The project models radiation pressure forces and evaluates acceleration under different reflectivity profiles relevant to interplanetary propulsion.

## Methods
- Classical radiation pressure equations
- Python-based numerical simulation
- Parameter sweeps over reflectivity and sail area

## Results
Key findings are summarized in the accompanying paper and visualized in the figures directory.

## Publication
The paper associated with this project is published on Zenodo:
